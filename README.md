# README.md
Inspire indigenous languages speakers for participating, learn and exchange for an open and linguistically diverse web.

Welcome! ¡Bienvenido! 

Thank you for visiting the Language activism/Activismo Lenguas project repository.

In this document (the README file) you will find more information about our project. You will find the information for each of the sections below, click on each to know more details, or otherwise scroll down.


## What are we doing?

### The context
There is an emerging movement in Latin America in which there are more and more indigenous peoples using digital media in their own native languages. Now you can find tweets, Wikipedia articles, free software locations and audio podcasts in indigenous languages.

The objective is to facilitate the creation networks that will bring together communities of digital activists who are champions for their languages online so they can exchange experiences and teach / learn new techniques and strategies to create a new generation of speakers that are working towards revitalizing their languages through the tools of digital media and the internet. 


### The problem
Many projects of digital activism in indigenous languages face technical, linguistic, and socio-cultural challenges that can be difficult to overcome without the information necessary to address them. 
There is little documentation or information on how to start, develop, and support a digital activism project of indigenous languages.

There is untapped potential on how to best integrate the existing knowledge and experience of other activists for the entrepreneurship and success of existing and new initiatives

So, it is necessary to build together with indigenous language digital activists whose projects are references, a process that allows people and communities interested in undertaking, advancing their projects to have a broader picture and some recommendations regarding inclusion of indigenous languages in cyberspace.

### Solution
The SDS-IL methodology will:
* Present resources that will help create and sustain projects according to the interests and objectives of those who undertake them
* Understand which methods set of methods or best practices can be applied to specific case
* Involve activists in the research process to propose a methodology to document and develop digital activism projects

This methodology is built by activists, and those thinking about participating in digital activism of indigenous languages on the Internet as a way to participate in society. The goal of methodology is not to provide solutions but to allow each initiative according to their situation to decide how to continue, what aspects to take into account and facilitate the development of initiatives to make them successful and achieve specific objectives. 

## Who are we?

The Indigenous Language Digital Activism Network is an initiative of Rising Voices, one of the initiatives of Global Voices, and created with the active participation of members of local networks. 

In principle, the project seeks to facilitate a community of indigenous language activists in Latin America who are currently using digital media tools to produce content in their own languages, in an effort to preserve and revitalize indigenous languages online. In addition, this community of mutual support helps promote the exchange of experiences and knowledge.

Through:
* Meetings and Workshops on Digital Activism of Indigenous Languages 
* Directory of activism experiences 

The founders of the SDS-IL methodology - Mónica, Eddie, Simona, Victoria, Misael, Rodrigo, Onesimo, Ruben, Heber, Lorenzo and Kiado- are friends and colleagues because they have worked on different initiatives promoting indigenous languages on the Internet. Also because many have met through the face-to-face meetings organized by Rising Voices. There’s more information about them (and some pictures) in the MeetTheTeam file.

The development of this methodology is mentored by the David Ross.  

Mónica is an invited member of the inaugural Open Leaders Cohort of the Rising Voices Director (Eddie Avila) who brought together indigenous languages advocates from Colombia to participate in the one meeting organized in this country. Rising Voices organized different meetings in several countries and from there the other activists that are currently part of the network are summoned. The meetings were spaces for discussion, training and focused on how to build and effectively engage communities so they can work together to develop tools and resources for the greater good.
