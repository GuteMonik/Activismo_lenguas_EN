# Activismo_lenguas_EN
The project seeks to create a portal for peer learning and exchange for communities participating in an open and linguistically diverse web. Built upon the shared experiences of indigenous language digital activists in Latin America, the portal will document existing initiatives of digital activism in native languages, resources to start a project what tools to use, and what strategies to follow to make your project of language digital activism sustainable.
